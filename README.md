## 1. Project Overview
The dataset represents customer interaction with Starbucks offers in a simulated rewards mobile app. Offers vary, ranging from promotional ads to incentives like discounts or "buy one, get one" deals. The project aims to explore how different demographic groups respond to these offers, combining demographic, transaction, and offer data to determine effective targeting strategies.  

## 2. Project Components
The project is structured as follows:
- Data Preparation:
    - Read and clean datasets.
    - Summarize data features.
    - Combine relevant data into a single cleaned dataset.
- Data Exploration:
    - Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    - Visualize key data insights.
- Model Building:
    - Split data into training and testing sets and scale features.
    - Train and evaluate machine learning models.
    - Optimize the best-performing model using hyperparameter tuning.
    - Analyze feature importance and model performance.
  
## 3. Installation
- Python (version 3) and Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
    - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
    - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
    - Machine Learning: SciPy, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost
